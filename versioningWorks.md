ex: Express has released several versions like 5.1.0, 4.19.1, etc., but currently I have version 4.18.5 installed. When I run npm i, it only updates to 4.19.1 — a minor version update. It doesn't automatically update to 5.1.0 because that's a major version change, which could introduce breaking changes and potentially crash the application.

~ -> Approximately equivalent to version

~5.1.7 ✅
~5.4.7 ❌
